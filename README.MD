# Gitlab Merge Request FLow

## What is
A tool for do following thing just one command line: 
 1. rebase remote branch, then
 2. push local branch, then
 3. create merge request, then
 4. merge it

## Why
0. A **real** example for **functional programming**(with `fp-ts` and `tagless final`) 
1. Get rid of the tedious work of pushing your code to the "main" branch.
